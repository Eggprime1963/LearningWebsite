# Learning Management System - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
The LMS follows a 3-tier architecture pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer** (JSP + Bootstrap)
   - User interface components
   - Client-side validation
   - Responsive design

2. **Business Logic Layer** (Servlets + Utilities)
   - Request processing
   - Business rule implementation
   - Authentication and authorization

3. **Data Access Layer** (JPA/Hibernate + MySQL)
   - Database operations
   - Entity management
   - Transaction handling

### Design Patterns Used

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Model**: JPA entities (User, Course, Lecture, etc.)
- **View**: JSP pages with JSTL
- **Controller**: Servlet classes

#### Data Access Object (DAO)
- Abstraction layer for database operations
- Centralized query management
- Transaction handling

#### Front Controller
- AccessControlFilter for centralized request processing
- Role-based routing and security

#### Dependency Injection
- Utility classes for shared functionality
- Service layer separation

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits credentials
2. LoginServlet validates against database
3. Session created with user details
4. AccessControlFilter validates subsequent requests
5. Role-based access control applied
```

### Password Security
- BCrypt hashing with salt
- Secure password storage
- Password strength validation

### Session Management
- Automatic session timeout
- Secure session handling
- Cross-site request forgery protection

### Role-Based Access Control
```java
// Example access control implementation
if (!AccessControl.validateAccess(request, response, AccessLevel.ADMIN)) {
    return; // Redirect to access denied
}
```

## Database Design

### Entity Relationships

#### User Entity
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private int id;
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private String role; // student, teacher, admin
    // Additional fields...
}
```

#### Course Entity
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "courses")
public class Course {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    @ManyToOne
    private User teacher;
    // Additional fields...
}
```

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Connection pooling for performance
- Query optimization with JPA criteria API

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- Bootstrap CDN for faster loading
- Minified CSS and JavaScript
- Image optimization for course thumbnails
- Lazy loading for large content

### Backend Optimization
- Connection pooling with HikariCP
- JPA second-level caching
- Efficient query design
- Proper transaction boundaries

### Database Optimization
- Indexed primary and foreign keys
- Optimized query execution plans
- Regular database maintenance
- Proper normalization

## Scalability Features

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless servlet design
- Database session management
- Load balancer compatibility

### Vertical Scaling
- Efficient memory usage
- CPU optimization
- I/O optimization for file uploads

## Monitoring and Logging

### System Monitoring
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- CPU utilization monitoring
- Database connection monitoring
- User activity tracking

### Logging Strategy
- Java Util Logging (JUL) implementation
- Log levels: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, FINE
- Centralized error handling
- Audit trail for admin actions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- DAO layer testing with embedded database
- Utility class testing
- Mock object testing for external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- Servlet testing with mock HTTP objects
- Database integration testing
- End-to-end workflow testing

### Security Testing
- Authentication bypass testing
- Authorization testing
- SQL injection prevention testing
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention

## Deployment Guide

### Production Environment Setup
1. **Application Server Configuration**
   - Java heap size optimization
   - Connection pool configuration
   - SSL certificate installation

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Production database setup
   - Backup and recovery procedures
   - Performance tuning

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Remove development features
   - Configure secure headers
   - Enable HTTPS only

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- Development: H2 in-memory database
- Testing: MySQL test instance
- Production: MySQL cluster setup

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Database backup and cleanup
- Log file rotation
- System health monitoring
- Security updates

### Troubleshooting Guide
- Common error scenarios
- Database connection issues
- File upload problems
- Authentication failures

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Mobile application support
- API-first architecture
- Real-time notifications
- Video streaming capabilities
- Advanced analytics dashboard

### Technical Improvements
- Microservices architecture migration
- Container deployment with Docker
- Cloud platform integration
- Advanced caching strategies
